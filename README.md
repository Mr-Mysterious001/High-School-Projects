# High-School-Projects

Ok, so my high school days are over and its time to go to a college. I messed up in my entrance exams a little bit and now i m having a tough time finding a college in India. I don't know what the future holds for me but now since I m free of studies for a few months, I decided to pursue my interest in computer science(even though I m not sure if I will get a degree in CS). So, currently I m Googling projects in java and trying to create the projects in my way and immerse myself in coding. I have learnt Java, Python and C# but since java is my main, I will be doing mostly java projects. IDK if anyone will see this but anyone reading this can give me suggestions and critic on my programs. 

Thanks for reading this. May u have a good day
